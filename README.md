This data contains the governor of every state or territory from 1775 to 2018. The governor's political party is included. Some governors were in multiple political parties during their lives so this variable may have multiple values for a single governor.

Parties prior to 1950 are completely unchanged.

For parties in years 1950-2018 I standardized spelling of some parties (e.g. "Democratic" to "Democrat") and if a governor was reported to be in multiple parties, set the party for a given year to the party that governor was in during that year.

All data comes from the [National Governors Association website](https://www.nga.org/cms/home).
